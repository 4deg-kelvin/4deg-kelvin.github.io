            <p>
              As part of the Physionet 2024 Challenge, I along with 4 other members in Edwards Lifesciences competed to 
              develop a computer vision pipeline to convert paper ECGs into a digital format. My task was create a pipeline 
              to deskew images of ECGs. 

              <br/><br/>
              I used a <b> computer vision transformer model, finetuning it based on synthetically generated scans 
                of ECG images.  </b> The model was trained locally on a GPU, and then dockerized and deployed to the Physionet servers. 

              Due to resource constraints, the model was not able to be used in the final product; however, the model did achieve 90% accuracy, and
              was explored as potential improvement to the rule-based method we used in our paper.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-sky-800 mt-8 mb-4">Publication</h2>
            <p>
              Our paper, <em> "Fusion of Deep Learning and Rule-Based Techniques for Enhanced Paper-Based ECG Digitization" </em> was accepted to the 
              Computing in Cardiology 2024 Conference. The paper details the development of our pipeline, and was given the award of <b>Best Preprint.</b> 

              <br/><br/>
              The paper was presented at the conference, and will be published in November.
